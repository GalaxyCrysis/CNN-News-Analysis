# Cnn_News_analyzing
Analyze and compare articles from CNN with 20newsgroup dataset

We get the articles from CNN Politcis via Beautifoul soup webcrwaling.
After that we analyze the articles via tfidf Vectorizer and predict them with Naive bayes classifier.
The Classifier was trained before with fetch20_newsgroup dataset from sklearn.
We compare the articles with the newsgroup and analyze all themes in the article with the categories from the newsgroup.
Finally we insert the data into our monogDB database and visualize our analysis via PyQt4
